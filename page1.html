    <h1>Section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
	<p>Section 230 is a law that was enacted in 1996 as part of the Communications Decency Act. It protects online platforms from being held responsible for the content that their users post. This means that if someone posts something defamatory or harmful on a platform like Facebook or Twitter, the platform itself cannot be sued for damages. Section 230 also allows platforms to moderate content by removing posts that violate their guidelines, as long as they are acting in "good faith." However, some politicians have called for changes to Section 230, arguing that social media companies have abused their protection and should have to meet certain government requirements to maintain it. </p>
    
    <p>Originally enacted in 1996, Section 230 states:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</p>
      <p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action taken voluntarily in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>This provision has been instrumental in fostering free speech and innovation on the internet. It shields online platforms from being held responsible for user-generated content, which has allowed for the growth of social media, user-generated websites, and other interactive services.</p>
    
    <p>Section 230 has been a topic of debate and discussion in recent years, with calls for reforms and reevaluations. Its interpretation and application continue to evolve as the digital landscape evolves.</p>
